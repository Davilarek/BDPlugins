# Plugins
## LastLogin

Allows you to see the last time someone has when online.

Although this plugin only tracks when discord is opening considering it takes account of when someones status changes to offline then caches the time.

Discord doesnt keep track of that... so we did it our own way.
## Inspect Element
Forcefully opens inspect element for those who have issues.
## Unshortener
Allows you to unshorten any url. 
- Please mind it uses a API outside discord [Unshorten](https://unshorten.me)
## SafeClick (W.I.P)
Allows you to safely click links and see the end result. Please mind this doesnt *fully* work.
## RecordAudio
Allows you send voice recordings on desktop
## MemberCountFix
This plugin is a fix of another plugin that was never fixed and was to overcomplicated to fix on the script itself.
Credit to SyndiShanX for bringing it up one day and letting me recreate it for him. 
## BulkSave
Allows you to download many images/videos in a message
